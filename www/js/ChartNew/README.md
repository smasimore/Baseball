ChartNew.js
===========


Simple HTML5 Charts using the canvas element




For my personnal use, I had to integrate lot of changes into Chart.js (https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js). 

So, I have re-worked Chart.js. Most of the changes, are associated to requests in "GitHub" issues of Chart.js.

June 2014 - [Ole Kr√∂ger](http://github.com/Wikunia) is now a co-developper of the project. More ideas, more people to give support. Welcome to him. 



New Charts integrated in this version compared to Graph.js

* HorizontalBar
* HorizontalStackedBar
* [Line,Bar with logarithmic y-Axis](../../wiki/100_110_Scale)
* [BarLine (bar chart with an integrated line chart)](../../wiki/070_020_Bar#barline)
	

New Items in graph compared to Graph.js :

* Title
* Subtitle
* X Axis Label
* Y Axis Label
* Unit Label
* Y Axis on the right and/or the left
* [Annotates](../../wiki/100_020_Annotations) (content can be configured through "templates")
* canvas Border
* [Legend](../../wiki/100_090_Legend)
* Footnote
* [crossText](../../wiki/100_040_CrossText) (you can put a text over the graph at the place of your choice)

A quick sample can be found on http://www.favomo.be/graphjs

This version is down-compatible (on PC) with the version of Chart.js available on 13 January 2014.

Hope it will be usefull for some of you ! Perhaps a start for a new community developpement... Why not ?

Using ChartNew.js, Omar Sedki has developped a graph generator. Though a user friendly interface, you can produce a graph and save it.
